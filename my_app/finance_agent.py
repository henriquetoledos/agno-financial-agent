# InvestorIQ
# What is goal of this application?
# This application is designed to assist private equity professionals in analyzing financial reports to answer questions from the Investors.
# The process is the following:
# 1. We have an already trained knowledge base, consisting of reports in xslx format (which we have an agent to convert to csv), and pdf files.
# 2. The user can ask questions about the reports, and the agent will search the knowledge base to find the answers.
# 3. Those questions can be submited individually, or in bulk, using an excel file. The agent must be capable of parsing the questions from the file, and then search the knowledge base to find the answers.

# We have a team of agents, each with a specific role:
# 1. **Question Intaker Agent**: This agent is responsible for receiving the questions from the user. It can handle multiple questions at once, and it can also read questions from Excel files.
# 2. **Searcher Agent**: This agent is responsible for searching the knowledge base to find the answers to the questions. It can also search the web for additional information if needed.
# 3. **Coordinator**: This agent is responsible for coordinating the work of the other agents. It decides which agent should handle each question, and it also formats the final answer to be sent back to the user.
# 4. **Excel Reader Agent**: This agent is responsible for converting Excel files to CSV format and analyzing the data. It can also handle multiple Excel files at once.
# 5. **CSV Analyzer Agent**: This agent is responsible for analyzing the CSV files and determining how to split them into different tables. It can also handle multiple CSV files at once.
# 6. ** Sanity Checker Agent**: This agent is responsible for checking if the answer provided by the Searcher is correct. It needs to ouptput the level of confidence in the answer, and if it is not confident enough, it should ask the Searcher to provide more information, or to answer that there is no suffience information
# 7. **Email Information Requester Agent**: This agent is responsible for sending an email for the private equity team to ask for more information about the question, in case there is no suffiecient or relevant information in the knowledge base

# For the interface, we have the following features:
# 1. The user can submit questions in the chat, or upload an excel file with multiple questions.
# 2. The user can submit new data for the knowledge base, be it Excel files, CSV files, or PDF files.

# ## üìù Usage Guidelines

# - **Agent Logic**:
#   - Pull from structured documents (e.g., annual reports, sustainability reports, cyber policies).

# - **Answer Classification**:
#   - Use tags like `B` (Basic), `O` (Operational), `CA` (Compliance-Aligned), `CM` (Compliance-Missing), etc., for internal tracking of completeness and maturity.

# - **Fallback Strategy**:
#   - If data is missing, tag with ‚ÄúNo data‚Äù and recommend outreach or clarification request from the company.
