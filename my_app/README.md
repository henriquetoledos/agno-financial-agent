## üìù Usage Guidelines

- **Agent Logic**:
  - Pull from structured documents (e.g., annual reports, sustainability reports, cyber policies).
  - Use NLP techniques to extract and normalize answers (e.g., classify GICS codes, standardize currencies).
  - Apply conditional logic (e.g., only ask follow-up questions if the previous answer was "Yes").

- **Answer Classification**:
  - Use tags like `B` (Basic), `O` (Operational), `CA` (Compliance-Aligned), `CM` (Compliance-Missing), etc., for internal tracking of completeness and maturity.

- **Fallback Strategy**:
  - If data is missing, tag with ‚ÄúNo data‚Äù and recommend outreach or clarification request from the company.
