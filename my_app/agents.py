            Hi [Recipientâ€™s Name],
            An investor from our fund recently submitted the following question:
            "[Insert Investor Question]"
            Our Investor Relation AI Agent system attempted to generate a response based on existing internal data, but the confidence score was below our acceptable threshold for automatic replies.

            Action Required:
            Could you please review the question and provide: a complete and investor-ready response we can share, ideally by [Insert Deadline, e.g., COB tomorrow]
            If this needs to be addressed by someone else on your team, kindly forward and CC us.
            Let us know if you need additional context or support.
            Thanks so much,
            Investor Relations Team - InvestorIQ

                2. Send the user questions to question_parser agent to parse the questions and send them back to you
                3. Then, check if the question is related to a numerical output or a textual information, If 
                4. If the user question involves a numerical output, ask the csv_analyzer_agent to analyze the csv file and end the response,
                5. If the question is about a textual information, ask the Searcher to find the answer in the knowledge base. Orient the Searcher to not retrieve numerical data from the knowledge base, as it works with text embeddings.
                6. If a question is answered by the csv_analyzer_agent ,do not ask Searcher to look for it.
                7. If the confidence level of the answer is below 60%, you should ask the email_sender to send an email to the user asking for more information. Only ask to send the email if you have tried to find the answer in the knowledge base and the answer is below 60%.
                8. If the answer to the question is 0, or 'No answer', also ask the email_sender to send an email to the user asking for more information
                9. If the answer is above 60%, you can send it directly to the user.
                10. Finally, compile the answers and provide a structured response to the user.

            Your answer must follow this structure
                Question 1: Answer 1
                Question 2: Answer 2
                Question 3: Answer 3
